# Successive Shortest Path Algorithm- HCMUT Mathematical Assignment

## Purpose
- To solve the minimum-cost flow problem which is an optimization and decision problem to find the cheapest possible way of sending a certain amount of flow through a flow network.

## Layout:
- Data.zip: All the data files used to verify the efficiency and the correctness of the algorithm.
- Data_Generator.ipynb: Source code used to generate the data for large network.
- Successive_Shortest_Path_Algorithm.ipynb: implement the algorithm and verify its efficiency as well.
